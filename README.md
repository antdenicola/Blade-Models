# Blade-Models
The Blade Models have been developed for the hybrid particle-field Molecular Dynamics (hPF) suitable for both biological and polymer composites systems. The models have coarse-grain (CG) and atomistic resolutions. 

Biosystems Blade Models have CG resolution in which a single bead is almost representative of four heavy atoms (four-to-one mapping). Currently, topologies are available for many surfactant structures, including the most diffuse phospholipids (zwitterionic and not), non-charged and charged surfactants like Triton TX-100 and SDS, and block-copolymers used in biological applications like Pluronics. New topologies will be released to enrich the library.
The Polymer Composites Blades Models have been developed at multiple resolutions, according to the application of them, covering atomistic resolution included hydrogens atoms up to very CG in which a single interaction site is representative of multiple monomers.
